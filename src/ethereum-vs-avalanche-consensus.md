# Ethereum vs. Avalanche: consensus (TODO)

##### Payload and data limit

The size of Ethereum block (set of transactions, unit of consensus) is limited by the gas rather than payload (see [doc](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/)). Each Ethereum block has a target size of 15-million gas, up to 30-million with more network demands. This means there are only 15 to 30-million gas available for each block (every 13-second). If there are high amount of traffic fighting over the gas to get their transactions settled, the gas fees can go up. Ethereum 2.0 that adopts PoS will increase the block creation throughput, therefore expected to reduce the fee.

TBD
